# class-based-Deep-NN
Implementation of Deep Neural Network using classes. 

Most of the ideas of this implementation has been taken from Andrew Ng's course on Deep Neural Networks. I just tried to implement the same using class. The helper functions,
hyperparameter values are all the same as in the course. 

Create a virtual environment and install libraries mentioned in requirements.txt by the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the following command to execute the program:
python src/DeepNN.py
