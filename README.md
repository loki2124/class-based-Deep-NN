# class-based-Deep-NN
Implementation of Deep Neural Network using classes. 

Most of the ideas of this implementation has been taken from Andrew Ng's course on Deep Neural Networks. I just tried to implement the same using class. The helper functions,
hyperparameter values are all the same as in the course. 

Use the following command to run-
python src/DeepNN.py
